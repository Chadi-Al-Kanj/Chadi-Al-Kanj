### Chadi's Portfolio

Welcome to my data playground! I love diving into various technologies in my free time. Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, spanning Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. These projects focus on tasks like data preparation, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and performance evaluation. They're a mix of passion projects, bootcamp capstones, and notes from online courses. 🛠️🔍📈💻
